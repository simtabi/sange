# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The security is a key priority for Simtabi, and we are committed to ensuring that our users are protected by promptly addressing security vulnerabilities. Below is a table outlining which versions of our project currently receive security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
|---------| ------------------ |
| >1.x.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

We encourage all users to run the latest, supported version of the software to ensure they are applying the most recent security patches and updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our projects seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability within our software, we encourage you to report it to us as quickly as possible. We welcome reports from everyone, including security researchers, developers, and our user community.

If you discover any security related issues, please email us at [security@simtabi.com](mailto:security@simtabi.com) instead of using the issue tracker.
